                <p>This is my first webpage; as you can see it's pretty blah so please bear with me. Let me tell you a little bit about myself.</p>
            </header>
            <p>I am a father of 4 beautiful children but my girlfriend and I have 7 children altogether, so as you can imagine we stay pretty busy at home running behind our youngest, Ainsley, <img src="images/IMG_20161230_095055.jpg" alt="Picture of Ainsley"> and trying to keep the rest of them<img src="images/20160903_142804.jpg" alt="Picture of the kids"> from pulling each other's hair out. I work hard to try to provide my children with a better life. It's hard living in struggle but unfortunately life is unfair, while some struggle to make ends meet, others waste money like they will never run out of it.
        My <a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> will give you a little idea about my professional experience.</p>
